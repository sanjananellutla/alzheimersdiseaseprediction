Analyzing the best Machine Learning Classification model for predicting the presence of Alzheimer's Disease

Using the dataset provided by ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), I have used Machine Learning classification algorithms and found the best model to predict the presence of Alzheimer's Disease in patients.

The following algorithms have been used to test for best prediction accuracy:
  1) Random Forest
  2) Support Vector Machine
  3) Logistic Regression
  4) K-Nearest Neighbors

I have analyzed and visualized the dataset using Tableau to understand the data patterns and physical and physiological insights of the patient samples.

The main.py file contains the source code
The ADNIMERGE.csv file contains the dataset
The AlzheimersVisualization.twbx contains the Tableau visualizations of the Alzheimer's Data
The CPSC597-ProjectReport_SanjanaNellutla.pdf contains the detailed report and instruction manuals on how to implement this project.
